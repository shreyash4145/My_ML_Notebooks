## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks that I have created while learning and experimenting with machine learning. The notebooks cover a wide range of topics, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. Each notebook is designed to be self-contained, with explanations and code that you can run and modify.

## Notebooks

Here is a list of some of the notebooks available in this repository:

1. **Introduction to Machine Learning**
   - Basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning.
   - Simple examples using Scikit-learn.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Techniques for cleaning and preparing data for machine learning.
   - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

3. **Regression Models**
   - Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression.
   - Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

4. **Classification Models**
   - Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
   - Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Clustering**
   - K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering.
   - Applications and evaluation of clustering algorithms.

6. **Neural Networks**
   - Introduction to neural networks using TensorFlow and Keras.
   - Building and training simple neural networks.

7. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
   - Text preprocessing, tokenization, and vectorization.
   - Sentiment analysis and text classification.

8. **Model Deployment**
   - Deploying machine learning models using Flask and Docker.
   - Creating REST APIs for model inference.
